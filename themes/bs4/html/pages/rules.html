			<p>The object of Texas Holdem is to make the best 5 card poker 
			hand from the 5 community cards on the table and your own 
			2 cards that only you can see. The community cards are dealt 
			out during the hand with betting rounds in between so you 
			are betting on the likleyhood of forming a winning hand 
			by the end of the hand when all cards are revealed.
			<br><br>
			A game consists of playing hands of cards and each hand 
			is split into alternating rounds of revealing cards and 
			betting on the results.
			<br><br>
			Your good buddy has lent you $10K to join a high stakes 
			poker game. Whatever profit or loss you make whilst playing 
			in a game will be added or deducted from your total bankroll 
			whenever you leave a table. The total bankroll determines 
			your player ranking.
			<br><br>
			Be careful not to lose the initial $10K or it's back to 
			your buddy to plead for more!</p>
